Utilising TensorFlow for Fashion MNIST Image Classification

In order to identify photos from the Fashion MNIST dataset, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras, as demonstrated by this Python script.

Prerequisites:

The TensorFlow website (https://www.tensorflow.org)
One can access Keras at https://keras.io and Matplotlib at https://matplotlib.org.
guidelines

Setting up: Use pip to install the necessary libraries.

Install keras matplotlib using bash pip. Tensorflow
Code should be used carefully.
Implementing the Script:

Save the code as fashion_mnist_cnn.py, for example, or another Python file.

Conveniently, it is advised to make the script executable.

Toggle between fashion_mnist_cnn.py and bash.
Code should be used carefully.
Using the command line, run the script:

Style_mnist_cnn.py is a Bash Python script.
Code should be used carefully.
